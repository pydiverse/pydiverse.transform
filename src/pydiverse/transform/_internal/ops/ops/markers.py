Specifies that nulls are placed at the beginning of the ordering.

This does not mean that nulls are considered to be `less` than any other
element. I.e. if both `nulls_first` and `descending` are given, nulls will still
be placed at the beginning.

If neither `nulls_first` nor `nulls_last` is specified, the position of nulls is
